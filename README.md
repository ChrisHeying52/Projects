Design of Experiments Project
Determined how Material Type, Print Orientation, and Infill Density of a 3D sample influence Storage Modulus, Loss Modulus, and Tan Delta using a Dynamic Mechanical Analysis (DMA) machine.
-Employed a full factorial experimental design in order to determine if any input factors influenced the response variables, and if so, to what magnitude.
-Identified statistically significant effects between input factors and response variables.
-Identified shortcomings in original design for future endeavors.
-Received an A+ on final report.

Senior Design Project
-Researched and designed an innovative surgical frame to facilitate Brachycephalic Obstructive Airway Syndrome (BOAS) surgery.
-Recognized as being the “Most Clinically Impactful Project” of the 2022 BME Capstone Projects as the device was successfully used during a live surgery at the UC Davis Veterinary Hospital with highly positive feedback from clinicians.
-Conducted interviews and a clinic-wide survey to gain a comprehensive understanding of important user needs.
-Performed a Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (FMEA) to identify and mitigate potential failure risks.
-Designed and performed Verification testing to ensure design output adhered to original design specifications and conducted  Validation to ensure the final design met user expectations.
-Collaborated with 4 other team members and a veterinary surgeon from the UC Davis Veterinary Hospital.
