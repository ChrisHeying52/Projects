Determined how Material Type, Print Orientation, and Infill Density of a 3D sample influence Storage Modulus, Loss Modulus, and Tan Delta using a Dynamic Mechanical Analysis (DMA) machine.
-Employed a full factorial experimental design in order to determine if any input factors influenced the response variables, and if so, to what magnitude.
-Identified statistically significant effects between input factors and response variables.
-Identified shortcomings in original design for future endeavors.
-Received an A+ on final report.
